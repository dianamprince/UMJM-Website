The Hollenberg Clinic was an important and significant contributor to healthcare models during the 1950s in Canada. Based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Clinic was a family-run enterprise, and was in operation from approximately 1949-1958. Based on in-depth interviews with family members and expert sources, as well as analysis of archival documents, a detailed historical description of the Clinic is made. It describes aspects such as Clinic personnel and training, layout and services, and areas of specialty expertise. The involvement of the Clinic physicians in the former University of Manitoba Faculty of Medicine, and research activities as clinician researchers, are highlighted. The argument is made that the Clinic closely modeled the integrative care model of the Mayo Clinic, and was the first in Winnipeg to link integrated care services with clinical investigative medicine.
