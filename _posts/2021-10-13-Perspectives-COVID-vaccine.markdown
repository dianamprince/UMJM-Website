Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, several vaccine candidates have entered development and received emergency authorizations. These include vaccines from companies such as Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca. Other promising vaccine candidates currently under investigation include Novavax and Sanofi. The rapid pace of vaccine development has provoked many questions concerning vaccine efficacy, logistics of distribution, and maintenance of safety standards. In the attempt to address these concerns, Dr. Scott McClelland, a principal investigator of the Novavax clinical trial, is interviewed. The resulting discussion explores his insight on the development of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on future vaccine advances. Perspectives on vaccine distribution in low-income countries is also highlighted. The interview concludes by reviewing vaccine distribution strategies moving forward in the pandemic.
